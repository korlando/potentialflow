      p
        strong Why is potential flow a relevant model of fluid flow?
      p <a href="/definitions#potential-flow">Potential flow</a> is an accurate model in any flow where the effects of <a href="/definitions#viscosity">viscosity</a> are negligible. This applies outside of boundary layers in aerodynamic and hydrodynamic flows. In most cases boundary layers are thin and attached to the solid surfaces, so <a href="/definitions#potential-flow">potential flow</a> is a widely applicable approximation.

      p
        strong What is the difference between potential flow and irrotational flow?
      p <a href="/definitions#potential-flow">Potential flow</a> occurs by definition when a flow is <a href="/definitions#irrotational">irrotational</a>, <a href="/definitions#inviscid">inviscid</a>, and <a href="/definitions#incompressible">incompressible</a>. Irrotationality is a necessary but not sufficient condition for <a href="/definitions#potential-flow">potential flow</a>.
    .pb10
      p
        strong Is potential flow necessarily inviscid and vice versa?
      p <a href="/definitions#inviscid">Inviscid flow</a> is a necessary condition for <a href="/definitions#potential-flow">potential flow</a>, but not all cases of <a href="/definitions#inviscid">inviscid flow</a> satisfy <a href="/definitions#potential-flow">potential flow</a>. <a href="/definitions#inviscid">Inviscid flow</a> can be rotational and therefore not satisfy the conditions for <a href="/definitions#potential-flow">potential flow</a>. <a href="/definitions#laplaces-equation">Laplaceâ€™s equation</a> is the governing equation for <a href="/definitions#potential-flow">potential flow</a>, but the <a href="/definitions#euler-equations">Euler equations</a> give the more general description of <a href="/definitions#inviscid">inviscid flow</a>, that may be rotational or <a href="/definitions#irrotational">irrotational</a>.

      p
        strong How can a vortex be irrotational?
      p A vortex with a velocity distribution that is inversely proportional to the radius is a free or <a href="/definitions#irrotational">irrotational</a> vortex. The <a href="/definitions#velocity-field">velocity field</a> is curl free ($\nabla \times \vec{v} = 0$), which satisfies irrotationality. This point vortex does have a central point where <a href="/definitions#vorticity">vorticity</a> goes to infinity, but everywhere else in the domain it is <a href="/definitions#irrotational">irrotational</a>.

      p
        strong How is a velocity field derived from a potential function?
      p In <a href="/definitions#potential-flow">potential flow</a>, the <a href="/definitions#velocity-field">velocity field</a> can be determined by taking the gradient of the scalar potential: $\vec{v} = \nabla \phi$.

      p
        strong How to find a potential from a velocity field?
      p The scalar potential can be derived from the <a href="/definitions#velocity-field">velocity field</a> by integrating the velocity components in accordance with the Cauchy-Riemann equations.
