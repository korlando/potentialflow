An equivalent statement is that the <em>velocity field</em> is curl free or has no <em>vorticity</em>. By definition, all <em>potential flows</em> satisfy irrotationality.

When considering the flow as a group of many small individual fluid particles, these individual fluid particles do not undergo any volume change in an incompressible flow. Effects of compressibility occur at high speeds in flow, and therefore the Mach number of the flow can be used to estimate if the assumption of incompressibility is valid. At Mach numbers of $\\textrm{Ma} \\lt 0.3$ flows are incompressible (cite source). The fact that sound can propagate through fluids proves they must be compressible in reality because sound is a compression wave. However, all fluids behave as incompressible at speeds that are small relative to the speed of sound.',

The concept of defining the fluid velocity with a field is fundamental to potential flow theory.

It is a vector defined at every point in the velocity field, and in a 2D flow, it’s vector direction is always into or out of the page. Intuitively this is related to rotation in the flow, and if you dropped an object into the flow vorticity would cause the object to spin.
